# Landing Page Project

This is a simple, dynamically modified landing page.
I used JAVASCRIPT to add list items to  the un order list in navigation bar,
and styled it by css.



I used some features to know active section and Add class 'active' to section when near top of viewport.

I also styled a design to The active class section.
I hope you enjoyed with my design.
